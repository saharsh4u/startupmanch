## Why this matters
A practical checklist founders can use before sharing their pitch. This guide is designed for operators building in public and trying to convert interest into action.

## Practical playbook
- Define one measurable goal for the week.
- Choose one audience segment and one channel.
- Publish a clear call-to-action that reduces decision friction.
- Track outcomes and iterate in the next cycle.

## Execution checklist
- Write a short summary that a first-time visitor can understand in 10 seconds.
- Link to one related internal resource and one CTA.
- Capture feedback from users and update the page copy.
